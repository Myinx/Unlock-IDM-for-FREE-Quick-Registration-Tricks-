# Important Note: 
Scripting IDM with the provided script is intended solely for personal use. It's crucial to understand that using scripts to modify or access software may not comply with the software's terms of service. While this script is shared with good intentions, the responsibility lies with the user to ensure adherence to both YouTube's policies and IDM's terms of service. We strongly encourage supporting developers by purchasing a valid license if IDM is valuable to you. Scripting is undertaken at your own discretion, and it's essential to be aware of potential risks associated with unauthorized modifications.
